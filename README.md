BEAT THE IDOLS:
SIDE NOTE: I am updating and redoing this project from a previous project (https://internet-idol-faceoff-beta-v1a.netlify.app/challenges/actives/all). It's kind of complicated, but I plan to add more features to this new one and as for the old one, the code is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD (not that this is any better, but...).
Anyway, about THIS project. So, this is an online "reality-show"-like app where you:
1. Create your profile (via registration).
2. Once registered, you will be taken to your own home-page. From there...
3. You can create your own "team" of singers (though, you can do other performers as well) by:
   (a) Copying/posting the url from YouTube (e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqh30MQ9wNM) into a form (as of now, I have not created a <form> page).
   (b) If you have a video stored inside your own computer (e.g.: .mp3), you can also upload it as well (the form will allow type="file").
4. After you uploaded your videos to your page (you team), you can then issue a public challenge by posting in a forum. Other users will then upload their videos.
5. OR... You can post a challenge with your OWN videos.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The audience (viewers) vote to see which video wins!

For each video, there will be a win/loss/tie record as well as a win percentage.
