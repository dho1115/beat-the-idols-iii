1. Inside ChallengeForm.jsx: For this component...
{
   challengeDetails.howChallengeEnds == 'date' && <ExpirationDateOption />
}
You may want to reconsider putting this in the ChallengeForm.jsx.

THE REASON: If the user wants to add a challenge announcement (challengeAnnouncementForm.jsx), then:

1a: You MUST ensure that the Expiration date for <ExpirationDateOption /> should be AFTER the challengeAnnouncement ends!!!

1b: Otherwise, what you have currently is fine.

2. Consider adding a dynamic statement. Maybe:
{
   (challengeDetails.howChallengeEnds && !challengeDetails._challengeAnnouncementID) == 'date' && <ExpirationDateOption />
}

3. Then, INSIDE ChallengeAnnouncementForm.jsx, you can add another <ExpirationDateOption /> where the MINIMUM DATE (min= after announcement expiration date) should be after the Expiration Date Option and the MAX should be 5 months after the announcement Expiratin Date.
